# The code herein describes the creation of figure the boxplot in Fig. 3A

Alpha diversity (OTU or in this case feature count) is assessed in python (although this simple type of measuring alpha diversity could also have been calcuated in excel) in alpha_diversity.ipynb.  

That data is then merged with metadata in R (resulting in all_alpha_diversity.csv) which is used for ANOVA and to make figures in TO_USE_richness.ipynb.
